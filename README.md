# MICROPROCESSORS_02_G10

It's a third year CSE project.
In this project we will implement 3 subsystems that can be used in a smart home. We will use two Tiva
boards that will communicate using UART.
Tiva C 1 will be connected to a servo motor (for example it can be used to rotate a surveillance camera), a
temperature sensor, and a LED (it can be analogous to lighting system in general).
Tiva C 2 will be connected to two push buttons (one for rotating the servo 30 degress clockwise and one for
rotating it 30 degrees counter clockwise) and both buttons should take actions on press only, LCD to show
reading of temperature sensor on Tiva C 1 board, Potentiometer to control the LED intensity on Tiva C 1
board.
Of course, in a real smart home Tiva C 2 can be replaced by a mobile application connected to Tiva C 1
through internet or Bluetooth or any other mechanism.

The system main components are:
- Two Tiva C Boards.
- LCD
- Servo Motor
- Potentiometer

## Tivas

* **TIVA 1 ** - [will be be the one connected to the motor and the LED]
* **TIVA 2 ** - [will be be the one Potentiometer and the Buttons.]
